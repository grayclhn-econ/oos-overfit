\markright{Supplemental Appendix}

This appendix presents simulation results that accompany
\citet{Cal:15b}. The Monte Carlo here is exactly the same as presented
in \citet{Cal:15b}, except that a recursive window is used. Please read
the original paper for further details.

\begin{itemize}

\item Figure 1 in this Appendix corresponds to Figure 3 in the
  original paper.
\item Figure 2 corresponds to Figure 4 in the paper.
\item Figure 3 corresponds to Figure 5 in the paper.
\item Figure 4 corresponds to Figure 6 in the paper.
\item Figure 5 corresponds to Figure 7 in the paper.

  {\large Coverage of recursive DMW OOS interval in simulations}
  \input{floats/mc-interval-generror1-rec.tex}
  \caption{Simulated coverage of $\E_T \oosB$ at 90\% confidence using
    a one-sided interval based on the recursive DMW \oost\ test,
    plotted as a function of the fraction of observations used in the
    test sample, $P/T$.  The solid horizontal line denotes the
    intervals' nominal coverage.}

  \caption{Simulated rejection probabilities for the recursive DMW
    \oost\ test under the null hypothesis that the benchmark model is
    more accurate, $\E_T \oosB \leq 0$. Nominal size is 10\% and is
    marked with a solid horizontal line. Values greater than 10\%
    indicate that the test rejects the benchmark model too often.}

    hypothesis that the benchmark model is more accurate, $\E_T \oosB
