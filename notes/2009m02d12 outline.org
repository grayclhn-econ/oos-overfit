One way to organize this is by section

* introduction
** write the introduction last
** you have most of a pretty decent intro, so just follow _Style_ advice
** you may need to brainstorm about this for a bit more
* TODO theory
** introduction to theory section
   so, you want to give an overview here of the main points of this section.
   In doing so, hopefully you'll prepare the reader for the stuff you're going to discuss.
   Maybe do around one paragraph each?
*** importance of avg future performance and expected future performance
**** expected future performance is more important for decisionmaking
**** average future performance might be of interest to a cover-your-ass decisionmaker
**** average future performance is more falisfiable
*** independence of theta-hat and the test sample
*** requirement that P^2/R be small
** DONE assumptions
   This section seems like it can be pretty short and doesn't require much different from what you have.
** TODO mixingale construction
   the point here is to explain where the dependence is coming from --
   the unknown coefficients.  You also want to give some intuition for
   why they're independent, why the series is weakly independent, and
   why it's not NED.
*** What the hell am I trying to say?
**** Under increasing-k asymptotics, the out-of-sample average doesn't
     converge to E(L(y - x'beta-true))
**** It does converge to E(L(y - x'beta-hat-R))
*** TODO rhetorical points to make
**** pseudo-out-of-sample period behaves as though it is independent of beta-hat-R
**** true-out-of-sample period behaves as though it is independent of period-T information
**** also get mixingale behavior for covariance estimate
*** DONE Theorems to prove in this section
**** DONE L_2-mixingale after centering
**** DONE Asymptotic normality centered at M(theta-hat-R)
** TODO test statistics
*** TODO motivate that we should care about M(theta-hat-T)
**** true out-of-sample average loss is centered at M(theta-hat-T)
***** do CLT for true oos loss?
**** Expected value in period-T is also centered there
*** TODO justify requirement that P^2/R -> 0
**** DONE present Lemma that the difference is of order P/root-R
**** give example for P/root-R -> infinity and the variance of the difference blowing up.
*** TODO "hypothesis test" for expected future performance
    The proof here is actually kind of tricky
**** simple cases
***** assume that M(theta-hat-T) were normal.
***** assume another distribution for M(theta-hat-T)
*** confidence interval for average future performance
    the proof here is pretty straighforward
**** DONE do for P/root-R converging to zero
**** show that the intervals need to explode for P/root-R diverging
* TODO comparison to previous theory
** TODO nonconvergence -- don't get an estimate of expected loss (at true betas)
*** give an example demonstrating
*** don't worry about giving a general proof that you can never get it
** TODO positive definiteness
*** TODO lay out a simple example showing where pd breaks down in West
**** do iid data - white noise plus one regressor for each model
**** make the example be for non-nested models
*** TODO give some conditions demonstrating that pd holds
* TODO empirical exercise
** TODO stock and watson JEL
   so in stock and watson's paper, they run a bunch of F-tests on spit
   samples and conclude that there must be breaks because the F-tests
   find significance but those models do poorly over the second sample.
*** TODO procedural - get the data and program up their models
**** TODO import the data
     this is mostly done; I just have to get the 'gap' variables in
**** TODO estimate their models
     now, they basically do bivariate AR models.
*** calculate intervals for average out-of-sample loss using in-sample techniques
*** calculate intervals for average out-of-sample loss using your technique
**** vary P -- how do the intervals vary
*** examine what the actual coverage for these intervals is
**** they use different countries' data, so you have a kind of nice exercise here
** possible extension to Stock and Watson (maybe split off into third chapter)
*** calculate intervals for performance over "future" -- ie the gap between when their study ended and now
**** for averge loss
**** for E_T of average loss (shouldn't be that different)
*** check coverage
* TODO simulations
  so the plan here is going to be to simulate data from different
  proposed exchange rate models (with different coefficients) then see
  whether E_T L is "good".  We also want to see the "size" for
  standard in-sample and out-of-sample approaches -- block on the
  model and the coefficients.
** decide on the DGPs
** draft code
*** simulate data from dgp
*** estimate recursive forecasts from regression models
*** calculate test statistics for each regression model
** output - do basic contingency table (see sheet)
