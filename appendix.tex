\maketitle

This appendix presents simulation results that accompany
\cite{Cal:14}. As in the main paper, these simulations were conducted
in R \citep{Rde:10} using the MASS \citep{VeR:02}, Matrix
\citep{BM:13}, rlecuyer \citep{SR:12}, and RSQLite \citep{Jam:10}
packages. Graphs were produced in R using Lattice \citep{Sar:10} and
tikzDevice \citep{ShB:11:0.6.1}.

  \caption{Simulated coverage of $\E_T \oosB$ at 90\% confidence using
    a one-sided interval based on the recursive DMW \oost\ test,
    plotted as a function of the fraction of observations used in the
    test sample, $P/T$.  The solid horizontal line denotes the
    intervals' nominal coverage.}

    \oost\ test under the null hypothesis that the benchmark model is
    more accurate, $\E_T \oosB \leq 0$. Nominal size is 10\% and is
    marked with a solid horizontal line. Values greater than 10\%
    indicate that the test rejects the benchmark model too often.}
