* Paper
** introduction
*** need to justify k/T asymptotics here
*** explain that we need to understand "overfit"
*** explain that existing theory doesn't give you correct confidence intervals
**** cite simulations
** assumptions and k/T asymptotics
** TODO theory
*** importance of avg future performance and expected future performance
**** expected future performance is more important for decisionmaking
**** average future performance might be of interest to a cover-your-ass decisionmaker
**** average future performance is more falisfiable
*** mixingale construction
**** pseudo-out-of-sample period behaves as though it is independent of beta-hat-R
**** true-out-of-sample period behaves as though it is independent of period-T information
**** also get mixingale behavior for covariance estimate
*** TODO behavior of out-of-sample averages
**** normal centered at E*(L | beta-hat)
**** independent of each other
*** TODO normality of d E*(L | beta-hat) * beta-hat
*** test statistics
**** for average future performance
**** for expected future performance
*** conditions that ensure positive definiteness
** simulations
*** based on confidence intervals
**** for average future performance
**** for expected future performance
*** based on size
**** for average future performance
**** for expected future performance (maybe -- might have to do a limited choice of T, or do big models)
