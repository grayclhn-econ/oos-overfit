Notes on the positive-definiteness of the pseudo out-of-sample average
loss difference.
* what am I trying to show?
  That $var_R \bar{D} - vh$ converges to zero in probability
* what do I know?
** Definitions
   + $\bar{D} = P^{-1} \sum_{t=R+1}^T D_t$
   + $D_t = L(y_t - \hat{y}_{1t}) - L(y_t - \hat{y}_{2t})$
   + $\hat{y}_{1t} = x_{1t}'\hat{\beta}_{1R}$
   + $\hat{y}_{2t} = x_{2t}'\hat{\beta}_{2R}$
** Assumptions
   + Assumptions 1--3 of the paper hold
* have I seen a similar result?
  of course I have---de Jong and Davidson basically prove this for me.
  The one thing that I need to account for is the covariance
  introduced by using horizons greater than one.
